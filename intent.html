        Mission statement.<br><br>
        To provide visual side of irrefutable information, which in a time of alternative facts, requires no fact-checking. A more potent and visceral means of surveying hard numbers. It both elucidates latent trends through cognitive pattern recognition faculties, but perhaps more significantly, acts as an immediate and visceral front to the hard information that is otherwise so easily dismissed via alternative facts and competing narratives. This is the electrate come to the spreadsheet. It both markets towards those graphics -hungry grant writers and coadta-consumers, but also enters a new social arena of sharable, digestible, tidbits. The visual compels, is transmitted, allows inspection and pattern recognition, and puts a body to ghostly numbers. A corpus to stand and take a beating, or to beat itself.<br><br>
        Of the postmodern, a theorist wrote it is a series of images, layered and glossy, which never unveil a hard substrate, but which peel off to other more obscure and obfuscated pornography.<br><br>
        Narratives are self-fulfilled, those few old guards of fact and knowledge are subsumed. Those who faintly recall discourse of fact cannot identify it even when they have it.
        Claims of objectivism are shadowed by critiques of assumptions, methods, financiers, repeatability, sample size, qualifications, and agenda. Valid claims seem indistinguishable from posers. Chinese archaeologists engineer false species for press. Korean physicists affirm a perpetual motion thruster. Non-phosphate based life is discovered in an American lake.
        The electrate induces visual communication, even in the absence of graphical information. The visual is sharable, consumable, inherently subjective / narrative, and fast. So what can Science hope to salvage from the electrate?<br><br>
        Analogous / parallel to fact-checking internet and its reliability, we find the image in a state of increasing shepherding. Images must be vetted, tagged, and disseminated through watchdog channels, lest they be distrusted.<br><br>
        There is often a disagreement between objective science and the aesthetic / subjective narrative. Both are part of the human condition; both are required to progress knowledge and society. Aesthetics without knowledge is masturbation. Knowledge without aesthetics is isolation. Knowledge paints a rough picture of the known world, which can only be communicated by spoken word, written word, or visual. Increasingly, we find the visual as the preferred means of dissemination both in social media and in scholarly publication. Pro
        Proper data visuals are not marketing. They are not misleading. They are not trending. These are potent tools of communication, without which one cannot hope to reach an audience as broadly or quickly as technology demands.<br><br>
        Media must reclaim its legitimacy in the eyes of the public. It must identify reputable sources from irreputable. It must establish systems of dissemination that obviate posers. It must refute the photoshop effect. It must become a tool of information: of trusted and substantial content. The potential is much higher with graphics than with text to convey quickly an enormous breadth of content. With properly visual hierarchies of detail, depth of information is also realized, where the viewer inspects more closely those major trends that were at once obvious.<br><br>
        The electrate: Gregory Ulmer.
        What literacy is to the analytical mind, electracy is to the affective body: a prosthesis that enhances and augments a natural or organic human potential. Alphabetic writing is an artificial memory that supports long complex chains of reasoning impossible to sustain within the organic mind. Digital imaging similarly supports extensive complexes of mood atmospheres beyond organic capacity. Electrate logic proposes to design these atmospheres into affective group intelligence. Literacy and electracy in collaboration produce a civilizational left-brain right-brain integration. If literacy focused on universally valid methodologies of knowledge (sciences), electracy focuses on the individual state of mind within which knowing takes place (arts).<br><br>
        The argument is that the disciplines of Arts and Letters have as much to contribute to the essential formation of electracy as do science, engineering, computing and related technical fields. Up until the seventeenth century, the technological and rhetorical dimensions of artificial memory developed together. The image logics of the memory arts were discredited in the context of the emerging empirical sciences because of their association with hermetic magic. One of the laws of media, according to Marshall McLuhan, is that innovation involves the retrieval of some features from the cultural archive thought to be obsolete.<br><br>
        Electracy needs to do for digital imaging what literacy did for the written word. The purpose of my pedagogy, then, is to learn to use the figural as a mode of image reason, as a supplement to the existing institutional commitment to argumentation and analysis.<br><br>
        “Today,” Virilio says, “the media no longer exists as narratives but rather as flashes and images. History is therefore being reduced to images”
